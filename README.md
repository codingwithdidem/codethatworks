# Code That Works.

It never actually works.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codingwithdidem/codethatworks.git
cd /codethatworks
yarn or npm install
yarn dev or npm run dev
```

## IMPORTANT

I have created a .env.local file. And it has UDEMY_API_KEY env variable. So maybe you can just remove /pages/courses/ for app to work.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
