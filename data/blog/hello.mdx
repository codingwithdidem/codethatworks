# Welcome

Hello there! This is the very first blog on this site.
It took me **so long** to build this lovely blog. So don't go now.
First of all let me tell you about the tech stack I used:

- Next.js (Upgraded to `v10`)
- `next-mdx-remote` (`next-mdx-enhanced` is fucking heavy.)
- Tailwind CSS ( I still can't center a div though :) )

I was constantly looking at Leerob's work [Leerob Repo](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io)
to build this blog. And thats my work: [My Work](https://github.com/codingwithdidem/codethatworks)

## What I will do with this blog?

> Sharing what you learn is a good idea

At least someone should have told us.

## Let's see how code looks like

```jsx
<div className="bg-gray-900 rounded" /> // Awesome!
```

## This blog is using MDX.

That means we can use _components_ here!
Maybe a `<Button/>`?

<Button>Love is a bitch</Button>

This is the actual code:

```jsx
// /components/Button.jsx

import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <button className="bg-purple-800 hover:bg-purple-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

```jsx
// data/blog/hello.mdx

<Button
  classes={
    'bg-purple-800 hover:bg-purple-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded'
  }
>
  Love is a bitch
</Button>
```
